# Development Log 1 - 13/07/21

A significant issue I have came across so far was actually figuring out what type of application I wanted to create. With a bit of brainstorming and research I decided only yesterday that I wanted to create a choose your own adventure type game. At first I had other ideas but I love writing stories and playing games so why not combine the two in Python. So far I haven't done much of the code but I am confident I will be able to create it with enough features. Right now I am focusing on the development and implementation plans as I believe they will assist me in creating the actual application. I am excited to compare both development logs when it gets closer to the due date to see how far I've come.

The application is coming together quite well so far, I have constructed most of the code and features and am now focusing on getting the documentation finished. I haven't came across too many problems so far however the bash scripting and testing I may need to do a bit more research on when I come around to it. So far I'm confident that I will finish the assignment on time and cover every aspect. I am excited to see the full application with the completed documentation and I am happy with the product so far. One main struggle I had was getting the 'for' loop to work precisely but with a bit of research I ended up figuring it out and getting it to work properly.
