## **Implementation Plan**

**How the features will be implemented:**

* Starting input validation feature: This will be turned into a function to make it easy to call within the program.
* Text and Dialogue Feature: This will consist of a few different functions that will all connect to eachother. It will also consist of elements from the time and sys module that will be imported.
* User choice feature: This will be turned into a function to enable fluency within the program. It will also consist of imports from the time module.
* Player Win/Lose Feature: This will be two seperate but similar features that are functions so they can be run at their specified time in the program.

**Priority for each feature:**

1.  User choice feature MVP - This is because this is the most intricate feature that contains the most coding (Functions, loops, variables, strings etc)
2. Text and Dialogue Feature - This is the second most important because it will take up a lot of time planning out the plot and purpose of the game, so it is good to finish it earlier rather than later.
3. Starting input validation feature - This is the third most important because as much as it is important, I don't believe it will be too time consuming.
4. Player Win/Lose Feature: This is last on the priority list because it is not too important for the application functionality but is a useful feature that will be added. It also is one of the features that requires most of the other features to be made first.
