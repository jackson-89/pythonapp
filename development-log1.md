# Development Log 1 - 13/07/21

A significant issue I have came across so far was actually figuring out what type of application I wanted to create. With a bit of brainstorming and research I decided only yesterday that I wanted to create a choose your own adventure type game. At first I had other ideas but I love writing stories and playing games so why not combine the two in Python. So far I haven't done much of the code but I am confident I will be able to create it with enough features. Right now I am focusing on the development and implementation plans as I believe they will assist me in creating the actual application. I am excited to compare both development logs when it gets closer to the due date to see how far I've come.
